\section{Overview}

Now that we have a number of useful abstractions, it's time to do something with them.  For this purpose, Vertebra has \operations{}.  The \operation{} is the fundamental unit of \textbf{work} in Vertebra.  At any instant, they tie the pieces together to make something happen.

Specifically, when an \operation{} is issued, the system discovers \agents{} that offer the appropriate \resources{}, then operation is dispatched to those \agents{}.  The \agents{} further dispatch the \operations{} to the appropriate \actors{} which actually do the work.  Finally, the responses stream back to the \agent{} that made the request for the \operation{}.
